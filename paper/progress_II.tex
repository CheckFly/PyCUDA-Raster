% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.


% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.


% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex


% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath


% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx


% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig


% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.


% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as

\begin{abstract}
    Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are used to in many different fields
    to analyze spatial data and plan accordingly. Geographic data has been
    growing in size exponentially, and while some GIS tools to analyze this
    data have been created, usage and efficiency have been lagging behind. The
    advent of massively parallel computing, specifically the availability of
    GPU programming, have made a more efficient solution possible since most
    GIS calculations are embarrassingly parallel. QGIS is an open source GIS
    platform that has gained much traction in the computational geography
    community. We are creating a QGIS plugin that leverages GPUs to increase
    calculation speed on large data sets. We are developing this plugin with
    the geography community in mind, using Python to make code easy to read,
    portable, and modifiable.

\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by the IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{P}{ARALLEL} computing has been adopted in many fields to improve
computation efficiency. Although many analytics in Geographic Information
Systems (GIS) are embarrassingly parallelizable, parallel computing has yet to
be largely adopted in the community. We're developing open source software for
parallel raster calculations to spur the GIS community to adopt parallel
computing practices. This plugin was built for the popular, open source GIS
software QGIS, that performs parallel slope, aspect and/or hillshade calculations 
on an arbitrary raster file.  We've implemented the plugin using Python and 
PyCUDA, an open source library for Python built on top of the CUDA programming
language for \textsc{NVIDIA} graphics cards. Our current results indicate a 
efficient, scalable improvement over similar serial calculations.

\section{Related Work} \label{related}
The idea of using parallel processing in GIS had been around for a long time
\cite{healy}, but only recently has been seriously considered.  Similar work on
creating open source, accessible parallel GIS tools has been done in the past,
though no one method has been widely adopted. The authors of \cite{guan}
created a C++ library for parallel raster file processing, though this only
uses CPU parallelization. \cite{benedicic} created a GRASS GIS module based on
cluster computing designed to predict radio-coverage.  GIS algorithms have also
been parallelized over clusters of machines rather than just CPU
parallelization, such as in \cite{huang}.  \cite{hpc_cuda} developed a C++
library for simple raster calculations using CUDA as an extension to the
proprietary ArcGIS software. We want to progress the work of \cite{hpc_cuda} to
be more accessible to the GIS community.

\section{Problem Outline} \label{problem}
    \subsection{Computational Challenges}
    GIS analytics perform many independent calculations on extremely large data
    sets. This proves problematic due to the memory limitations of a single
    machine, and the massive amount of calculations needed to run. Data sets 
    typically analyzed by GIS can be in the terabyte (TB) size realm. With
    most computers only having memory capabilities in the gigabyte (GB) range,
    steps must be taken to work around running out of memory. Both the large size
    of data sets and the requirement that each piece of data be analyzed separately
    slows down processing time dramatically. Input from and output to data sets
    and memory have proven to be a major component to the slow down.  However
    performing the large amount of independent calculations through serial
    programming also bogs down the process. Our goal is to build a system that
    maximizes Input/Output (I/O) throughput as well as reduce computation time
    through parallelism.

    \subsection{Ease of Use}
    Use of parallelism in GIS has been explored in the past, yet despite its proven
    benefits over serial calculation, the GIS community has been slow to adopt
    parallel computation. This is largely because the introduction of parallelism
    makes code much more difficult to read and write. Parallelism is something that
    many experienced programmers struggle with, let alone the many members of the
    GIS community who have little to no experience with programming. With this in
    mind, we have tried to write the parallel processing tools presented here in a
    simple, easy to modify way without giving up the power of parallelism
    altogether.  For those who don't even want exposure to any source code, we have
    provided a plugin to the popular, open source GIS QGIS with a simple GUI that
    runs the parallel code.


\section{Methods} \label{methods}
    \begin{figure}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{model.png}
        \caption{Main work flow model.}
        \label{model}
    \end{figure}
    \subsection{Scheduler Model}
    The previous work done in \cite{hpc_cuda} revealed that the greatest
    hindrance to performance in GPU based GIS calculations is the transfer of
    data from disk to main memory, and then from main memory to GPU memory.
    Memory transfer must occur four times for each GPU job, loading from disk
    to main memory, loading from main memory to GPU memory, and then copying
    results from GPU memory back to main memory, and then to disk.  Further
    compounding the problem is that GPU memory is typically more limited than
    main memory, so multiple copies from main memory are required for files
    larger than the available memory on the GPU. Thus we have designed our
    work flow to try to mitigate the effects of the I/O bottleneck.

    Figure \ref{model} shows our design model. There are three main processes,
    the data loader, the data saver, and GPU manager. Broadly, the data loader
    is responsible for loading data from disk and formatting from its initial
    file type, the data saver is responsible for compressing and saving data
    back to disk, and the GPU manager is responsible for running GPU tasks,
    including copying data to and back from the GPU. The three processes are
    described in more detail in section \ref{implementation}. The three
    processes run independently, so data can be loaded from disk, calculations
    can be performed on the GPU, and data can be saved to disk all
    simultaneously.  This provides parallelism both on the CPU for I/O, and on
    the GPU for calculations, improving overall computation time.
    
    \subsection{GPU Kernel}
    The GPU kernel is designed to perform analysis on individual cells in a
    raster file based on a 3x3 grid around the cell. The kernel was designed to
    be modular so that any kind of calculation can be done based on the 3x3
    grid of neighbors. A user simply needs to write the desired calculation,
    and the rest of the kernel was written to fetch the correct data, ensuring
    that all of the correct data is available on any given thread for a 3x3
    grid calculation. The kernel uses a grid striding loop for flexibility and
    efficiency\cite{grid_stride}.

    \subsection{GIS Algorithms}
    The algoirthms we are implementing utilize a 3x3 cell neighborhood around each 
    calculated cell. 
    \begin{figure}
        \center
        \includegraphics[width=2in]{GISgrid.jpg}
        \caption{3x3 cell neighborhood}
        \label{GIS grid}
    \end{figure}
    This 3x3 grid is used to calculate the rate of change from east to west
    \(\frac{dz}{dx}\) and the rate of change from north to south
    \(\frac{dz}{dy}\). These are found as follows:
    \[\frac{dz}{dx} = ((c + 2f + i) - (a + 2d + g) / (8 * x\_cellsize)\]
    \[\frac{dz}{dy} = ((g + 2h + i) - (a + 2b + c)) / ( 8 * y\_cellsize)\]
    With these rates of change now found they can be used to calculate slope,
    aspect and hillshade. Slope is the maximum rate of change in elevation
    between the cell and its neighbors.The lower the slope value the flatter
    the land is. It is calculated with the following formula:
    \[Slope = ATAN\Bigg(\sqrt{\Big(\frac{dz}{dx}\Big)^{2} + \Big(\frac{dz}{dy}\Big)^{2}}~\Bigg)\]
    Aspect relates to slope to identify the direction of the downslope. Aspect
    is found  using conditional steps and is calculated in degrees, which can
    be converted to radians.
    %If \(\frac{dz}{dx}\) or \(\frac{dz}{dy}\) equals a no data value
    %\[Aspect = no data value\]
    \[Aspect = 57.29578 * ATAN2\bigg(\frac{dz}{dy}, -\frac{dz}{dx}\bigg)\]
    Hillshade is the hypothetical illumination of the surface when the sun is
    at a specific height and angle in the sky. It is a more complex algorithm
    and relies on slope and aspect being calculated in addition to finding the
    illumination angle zenith (abbreviated \(zen\) and illumination
    direction azimuth (abbreviated \(azm\). We have defaulted these values
    to 45 degrees and 315 degrees respectively.
    \begin{align*}
        Hillshade =& ~ 255.0 ((COS(zen) * COS(slope)) ~ +  \\
                   &(SIN(zen) * SIN(slope) * COS(azm - aspect))
    \end{align*}
    %\[Hillshade = 255.0 ((COS(Zenith) * COS(Slope)) +  (SIN(Zenith) * SIN(Slope) * COS(Azimuth - Aspect))\]

    \subsection{QGIS Integration}
    \begin{figure}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{gui.png}
        \caption{Snapshot of plugin GUI.}
        \label{gui}
    \end{figure}
    We have constructed a QGIS plugin, depicted in figure \ref{gui} which uses
    our data processing pipeline and presents a simple GUI where a user can
    select an input file, output file, and operations to perform. This way,
    once the plugin is installed, a user need not even interact with the
    command line, or learn to use a new piece of software in order to perform
    GPU calculations. We have also tried to allow users to load data directly
    from QGIS rather than from disk, but this software is still unstable.

\section{Implementation} \label{implementation}
    Our program is implemented primarily in Python 2.7. We chose to write the
    program in Python because it is relatively easy to read and write, and also
    allowed us to produce shorter, more compact code than the C or C++ code
    typically used with CUDA.  Although Python is slower than C or C++, we
    thought the readability trade-off was worth it so that others in the GIS
    community could read, test, and modify our code. In order to still get as
    much efficiency as possible, we used the GDAL libraries, Numpy, and PyCUDA
    \cite{pycuda_1} \cite{pycuda_2}. PyCUDA serves as a wrapper for CUDA C that
    handles many of the ugly details of memory allocation and transfer to the
    GPU.  Unfortunately, kernel code to be executed on the GPU must still be
    written in C. 
    
    Our program's structure follows the model in figure \ref{model}. The
    following sections describe the implementation of each process.

\section{Analysis}
Timing our implementation for parallel slope calculation from a raster file
against the standard serial method used in QGIS has revealed the input and
output will be our biggest hurdle to overcome. Testing with a 23 MB data file
our implementation completed on average in nine seconds while the QGIS method
finishes on average in five seconds. Moving to a 200 MB file the time
difference increased with QGIS completing in 15 seconds and our version
finishing in 51 seconds. While testing these files, we noticed that calculation
time on for the PyCUDA version appears to be instantaneous after reading the
file into memory, while calculations in QGIS are noticeably taking time to
complete. Moving on to even larger file sizes, in the GB range, is where
conflicts arose. While testing  a 3.1 GB file, the PyCUDA implementation completed
in 11 minutes, only a minute slower than QGIS. A similar occurrence happened with
a larger 8 GB file, with the PyCUDA taking 15 minutes more than QGIS. These times
are very encouraging, showing that Python code is approaching equal times with QGIS.
We are confident that these times can be lowered as we work to fix bugs in our
current code base and explore options to optimize our current algorithms.

\section{Conclusion}
We have developed a PyCUDA based, open source raster calculation plugin for
QGIS. The plugin ensures that neither memory on the host device or GPU will be
overpopulated, and utilizes multithreading so that I/O and GPU computation can
occur simultaneously. Our initial results indicate that our implementation
competes closely with the standard serial C++ implementation of raster
algorithms used by QGIS on small files, and may surpass it on large files.  It
is our hope that since QGIS is a popular freeware GIS, that our plugin will be
widely adopted and modified by the community to fit various specific needs.

\section{Future Work}
Our primary goal is to fully develop the plugin and publish it to QGIS so
members of the community can start to use it and customize it for themselves.
Secondly, the plugin only supports calculating slope and accepts input and
output in the form of ESRI ascii format. This represents a problem as this
format requires significantly more disk space for storage. We hope to expand
this support to GEOTIFF files or another common format. Additionally, our file
I/O currently only uses some bare-bones optimizations. We would like to
investigate different I/O schemes to see what is optimal.
