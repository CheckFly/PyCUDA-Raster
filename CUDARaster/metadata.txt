about=This plugin uses CUDA enabled graphics cards to perform raster calculations. The QGIS GUI allows you to select an input file, output file and what kind of calculation you would like to do. This plugin currently supports reading and writing .asc files and .tif files. If you navigate to the plugin folder, it can also be used as a command line utility where multiple calculations can be run in one job. See the README there for more information on using the plugin as a command line utility separate from QGIS. Dependencies: CUDA 6.0 or higher https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads Numpy http://www.numpy.org/ Python GDAL https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL/ PyCUDA https://mathema.tician.de/software/pycuda/ You will need to make sure that the folder where you have installed CUDA is set to your path before starting QGIS and trying to install this plugin.
